Or more correctly, it *can* be used but over any significant area of Earth surface substantial distortions will result.\n",

The most important of these is that we need to know projection is a thing!  The second is that **there is no perfect projection** just different projections that we might prefer for different purposes.  Of particular importance are **equal-area** projections, which preserve the relative area of regions on Earth surface and **conformal** projections which preserve shape.  Any given projection can only be effective over a limited area of Earth surface (where the approximation to a flat plane is adequate).\n",

For example, the equation for the distance between two locations with lat-lon coordinates $\\left(\\phi_1,\\lambda_1\\right)$ and $\\left(\\phi_2,\\lambda_2\\right)$ is given by (see [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula). \n",

    "The first one is detailed **PROJ4** information that enables lat-lon to be projected into the coordinate system of interest. PROJ4 is a standard that enables spatial tools (such as geopandas, or a GIS) to decide what mathematical transformations need to be applied to convert in to or out of that coordinate system.  We can see (with a little practice) that this is a projection that is equal-area ('aea'), which results in coordinates in meters (`'units': 'm'`). \n",

    "Even more useful, is [this website](http://projectionwizard.org/) which will help you make an informed choice about a suitable coordinate system with desired properties for the regional extent of the data you are working with. You specify the spatial extent of your data and the property you want (equal area, conformality, or equal distances) and it will generate the PROJ4 string you need.  You can use this in `geopandas` with the `to_crs()` function to convert a dataset to a desired projection.  You will see examples of this in this notebook. \n",
