    "# Introducing geopandas\n",
    "In the next two weeks we will use the [geopandas](http://geopandas.org/) package to explore some key challenges of dealing with spatial data in the context of data science. That name probably requires at least a little bit of explanation. [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/index.html) is an advanced package for manipulating tables of data.  The name is an approximate acronym for Python Data Analysis library.  Many of the capabilities pandas offers are available in the datascience package you have been using in foundation class, although pandas more advanced features mean that it is not an especially easy package to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, geo-pandas combines pandas (data tables) with number of other packages, in particular, shapely (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely) which deals with geometry and fiona (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fiona) which handles spatial data formats.\n",
